            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc">I’m a passionate Full Stack Web Developer focused on building responsive,
                user-friendly, and scalable web applications. I enjoy transforming ideas into functional digital
                experiences using modern web technologies. From designing clean front-end interfaces with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript to developing efficient back-end systems, I love working on every layer of the development
                process. I am continuously learning and improving my skills in both frontend and backend development. My
                goal is to create websites that are not only visually appealing but also fast, secure, and optimized for
                performance. I believe in writing clean code, solving real-world problems, and building projects that
                make an impact.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alongside web development, I also have strong creative skills in poster designing and photo editing. I
                enjoy crafting visually engaging posters and enhancing images with attention to detail, color balance,
                and composition. My design skills help me bring creativity into my web projects, ensuring they look
                modern and attractive.
